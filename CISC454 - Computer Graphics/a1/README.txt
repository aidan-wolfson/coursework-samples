Assignment 1

Notes: 
I struggled with getting the random functions to work properly for the flea. As a result, it
doesn't spawn correctly throughout the game and isn't the most varied in terms of *where* it spawns.
That also meant it pretty much spawns mushrooms all the way down the column it travels down.
Apologies for that, I would have liked to keep troubleshooting that but I ran out of time as I'd already 
spent so long on the assignment.

All in all, I think most of the functionaility is in there and working. Thanks!!
